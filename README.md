# ESS-conditions-indirect-reciprocity-with-noise

This repository contains the source code for the numerical verification of the
results from the project ``Exact conditions for evolutionary stability in
indirect reciprocity under noise'', along with scripts to generate data and plot
the figures shown in the manuscript.

The project is currently under review and is by Nikoleta E. Glynatsi, Christian
Hilbe, and Yohsuke Murase.

The code is written in C++, and the plotting scripts are in Python.


## Build

To build the project, clone the repository and use CMake:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Nikoleta-v3/ESS-conditions-indirect-reciprocity-with-noise.git
cd ESS-conditions-indirect-reciprocity-with-noise
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```


## Source Code and Executables

The main source files in the project are:

1. `Norms.hpp`: Defines norms, including the assessment and action rules.
2. `NormsWithPunishment.hpp`: Similar to `Norms.hpp` but for the three-action case (Cooperation, Defection, Punishment).
3. `Game.hpp`: Defines the game. This includes the resident's payoff and
   cooperation rate, $\Delta_v$, mutants payoffs, and includes functions such as
   the ESS conditions.
4. `GameWithPunishment.hpp`: Same as `Game.hpp` but adapted for the three-action game.

Each file has associated unit tests. After building the project, the following
executables will be available in the `build` directory:

* `test_game`: Tests that the ALLD action rule is always an ESS, and verifies results for the leading eight and secondary 16 norms using Theorem 1.
* `test_game_with_punishment`: Tests that the ALLD action rule is always an ESS using Equations 28â€“30.
* `test_norms`: Unit tests for `Norms.hpp`.
* `test_norms_with_punishment`: Unit tests for `NormsWithPunishment.hpp`, including those used in Table 3.
* `main_nash_search_with_P`: Verifies the results shown in Table 3.


## Reproducing Figures

### Data

After building the project, the following executables will be available in the `build` directory:

* `leading_eight_with_errors`
* `equalizers_norms`
* `L6_L3_payoff_difference`

These generate the data necessary for creating the figures in the manuscript. To
run them, you need to specify an output location. We recommend using the `Data`
folder provided in the repository.

To run a script from the `build` folder:

```bash
./leading_eight_with_errors ../Data
```

Or from the root of the repository:

```bash
build/L6_L3_payoff_difference Data/
```

After running all three scripts, navigate to the `Data` folder and you should see the following files:

```bash
equalizers_payoffs.csv
L6_L3_payoff_difference.csv
leading_eight_ESS_with_errors.csv
README.md
```

### Figures

To replicate the figures of the manuscript, run the Python script `generate_figures.py`.
If you're in the root directory, use the command:

```bash
python scripts/generate_figures.py Data/
```

The script takes the path to the folder containing the data as an argument,
and it saves the output in the `Figures` folder.

If you're interested in the individual code used to generate each figure, the corresponding scripts can be found in the `scripts` folder:

* `generate_figure_l8_errors.py`: generates Figures 1 and 4
* `generate_figure_equalizers.py`: generates Figure 2
* `generate_figure_l3_l6_payoffs.py`: generates Figure 3
